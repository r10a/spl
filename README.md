Phase 1: Implement a Scanner using the SPL language specification.  
Phase 2: Implement a Parser which uses the Scanner from the previous phase.  
Phase 3: Implement an AST generator using the Scanner output.  
Phase 4: Implement Type Checking in the generated AST.  
Phase 5: Implement Intermediate Code generation from the generated AST.  
Phase 6: Implement Machine code generation for the MIPS instrucution set.
